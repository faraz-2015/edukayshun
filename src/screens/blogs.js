              The cloud market continues to grow, so it is no wonder that the
              cloud stack has been a hot topic for nearly a decade now. There
              has been a lot of talk of its value to corporations and the
              exponential development of third-party clouds. Cloud computing,
              often described as a stack, has a wide range of services built on
              top of each other under the cloud name. Cloud computing can be
              classified as one of three services: SaaS software, PaaS platform
              and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). They are referred to as "a
              service," because they are purchased by corporations from third
              parties as a service. It's the cloud computing stack together.
              Cloud computing stack is parallel to traditional hosting.
              Companies have traditionally hosted their own private physical
              networks and equipment, infrastructure, data centers and servers,
              applications and software. The software sits on top of the
              programming environments that are physically built. The cloud
              computing stack parallels traditional hosting. A solution must
              display specific features in order to optimize the benefits of
              cloud computing. Over the last few years, a number of conventional
              tech providers have promoted solutions such as cloud computing, a
              process known as cloud washing.

              IaaS products provide all applications with the underlying
              structure that can be used as hardware counterparts in
              conventional stacks. Amazon Web Services, which offers on-demand
              computing, storage and networking capabilities, is one of the most
              popular example of this. IaaS is similar to a data center, but
              without the need for customer planning or maintenance. It is used
              in the development and deployment of PaaS and SaaS apps. As the
              barest bones of the framework, IaaS provides the greatest control
              and customization amongst the three cloud computing services.

              PaaS products take care of the middleware that is all between the
              program and the operating system and the hardware (servers). PaaS
              is an application platform that is used by the programmer. Moving
              away from SaaS means that it is not a ready-to-built end-user
              application, but rather a 'coding world,' enabling applications to
              be more customized. Examples include Google App Engine and
              Microsoft Azure, respectively.

              Salesforce (CRM), Basecamp (for collaboration) and Dropbox (for
              storage) are the most common examples of SaaS. The interface
              provides companies with the option of using an invisible
              integrated platform and infrastructure immediately. This form of
              software is typically paid by customers monthly or yearly rather
              than strictly sold.

              Cloud solutions are replacing traditional stacks at an accelerated
              pace. In future, Cloud products will be a staple of companies,
              ranging from applications to platforms and computer
              infrastructure. If you're looking for a cloud solution, look at
              the customizability, collaboration and dynamic scalability needs
              of your company as well as security and privacy issues.
